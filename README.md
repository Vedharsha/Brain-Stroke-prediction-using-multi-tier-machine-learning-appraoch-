# Brain-Stroke-prediction 
The proposed project was an extended project.
## Credits
This project, Module 1, is taken from [Danish Nawab]([(https://github.com/danishnawab55)]) ([https://github.com/danishnawab55/Brain_Stroke_Prediction]).
Modules 2 and 3 extended by [Vedharsha V].

Module 1: Brain stroke prediction
Seven Classifiers are used and merged into one model(Max-Voting Classifier)
Dataset: healthcare dataset from Kaggle
models:
Decision Tree
Logistic Regression
Random Forest
K-Nearest Neighbours

Module 2: Stroke Type classification
Dataset: symptoms.csv extracted from the stroke prediction dataset (Kaggle)
Model: J48

Module 3: Stroke risk progression
Dataset: Stroke prediction dataset (Kaggle)
Model : MLP (Neural Network)
