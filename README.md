# Brain-Stroke-prediction 
The proposed project was an extended project.  
  
  **CREDITS**  
This project, Module 1, is taken from [Danish Nawab] [https://github.com/danishnawab55] [https://github.com/danishnawab55/Brain_Stroke_Prediction].  
Modules 2 and 3 extended by [Vedharsha V].

## Module 1: Brain stroke prediction
Seven Classifiers are used and merged into one model(Max-Voting Classifier)  
Dataset: healthcare dataset from Kaggle  
Models:
1. Decision Tree
2. Logistic Regression
3. Random Forest
4. K-Nearest Neighbours
5. Support Vector Machine
6. Gaussian Na√Øve Bayes
7. XGBoost


## Module 2: Stroke Type classification
Dataset: symptoms.csv extracted from the stroke prediction dataset (Kaggle)   
Model: J48

## Module 3: Stroke risk progression
Dataset: Stroke prediction dataset (Kaggle)  
Model: MLP (Neural Network)
